Using the Formula for Power, 

P=V*I/n

We will get the Values of Id as,

Id= 5.56 * 10^-5 A

we have to get the output current, Id for the given circuits by adjusting the values of L & W( Length and Width of the Channel of the MOSFET)

Length and Width of the Channel used to obtain the given Current is shown in the figure below;

1) DC ANALYSIS:

   Procedure for Performing DC Analysis:
   we have to select the dc output print(DC op pnt) in the Edit Simulation Command and Run the Simulation

2) Transient Analysis:

   Procedure for Performing Transient Analysis:
   we have to select the Transient Analysis in the Edit Simulation Command,  Give the stop time as 1ms and Run th Simulation.

3) AC Analysis:
   Procedure for Performing AC Analysis:
   we have to select the AC Analysis in the Edit Simulation Command,  Give the values as shown in the figure beowl and Run th Simulation.
